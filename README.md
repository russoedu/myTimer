Smoke and the Water is a simple recurrent timer to help you to control how many cigarettes you üö¨ smoke, how many ‚òïÔ∏è coffee you drink and help you to remember you to drink pure clean üö∞ water.

Sure you can use it to remember daily stuff‚Ä¶ but it was created for my own health needs üò¨.

## Configuration

### Default configuration

The default configuration can be changed but can't be removed from the timers folder.

The **default configurations are used only when a configuration is not set**. For instance, you can set a single "endTime" for all your timers in the default.json and all timers will use this config. If you have a timer that needs a different "endTime", this configuration will overwrite the default.

## Configuring your timers

Configure or edit the other timers located in the timers folder.

```json
{
  "title": "Remember",
  "message": "üç∞ The cake is a lie",
  "name": "lie remembered",
  "endTime": "23:30",
  "bgColor": "bgYellow",
  "quantity": 5,
  "reminders": [
    "00:30:00",
    "00:45:00",
    "01:00:00"
  ],
  "media": {
    "terminal": true,
    "computer": true,
    "phone": true
  },
}
```
You should set:

| Option        | Usage |
| :------------ | :------------- |
| **title**     | used in the desktop alert |
| **message**   | message for the alert used in all versions |
| **name**      | the name used to show how many times you did that timer |
| **endTime**   | when you want your timer to give the last alert in the day |
| **bgColor**   | terminal background color |
| **quantity**  | the number of times you want this to be repeated |
| **reminders** | list with the repeat timers in "hh:mm:ss" format. If you have less timers than the number you set in `quantity`, the rest of the reminders will be distributed until the `endTime`. The time must use `hh:mm:ss` format. |
| **media**     | object to define where the alerts should be displayed. **If none is set**, not even in the default `.json`, **only terminal alert will be displayed**. |

## Mobile push
To use the mobile push you need to install the app [Push Me](http://pushme.jagcesar.se) and get your key. In the app, click on the key to copy to the clipboard.

Then you need to copy or rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and insert your key.


## Usage

First, install all nee packages with `npm install`.

Then, create your timers (timers folder).

Finaly, run `npm start` and the app will run, alerting you in the computer and on your phone.

## TODO

### Working on‚Ä¶

- New `reminders` options to make it easier to crate your time table:
 - "in": "Time after the beginning"
 - "after": "Time after the previous"
 - "at": "On an exact time of the day"

```
"reminders": {
  "Do something fun": {
    "in": "00:00:00"
  },
  "Read news": {
    "in": "00:30:00"
  },
  "Go brush your teeth and your hair!": {
    "in": "01:00:00"
  },
  "Go to work": {
    "after": "00:05:00"
  },
  "Check Trello": {
    "after": "01:00:00"
  },
  "Work": {
    "after": "00:15:00"
  },
  "Do something fun!!!": {
    "after": "03:45:00"
  },
  "Prepare dinner": {
    "at": "18:00:00"
  }
```

- Possibility to disable alert on some days:
- 
```
"enable": [
  "weekdays",
  "weekends",
  "sun",
  "mon",
  "tue",
  "wed",
  "thu",
  "fri",
  "sat",
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
]
```


### Mandatory

- ~~Calculate the remaining alerts.~~
- ~~Finish execution after all timers finish.~~
- Check if all needed config are filled or have default values.
- ~~Make sure `quantity` is smaller than the length of `reminders`.~~
- Create tests.
- ~~Look for performance issues.~~

### Nice to have

- Create better CLI interface
- Create config wizard
- Let user define the first alert instead of setting when the app starts
- Set individual messages for each timer (change `reminders` from an array to an object)

### Maybe in the future‚Ä¶

- Create Electron app

MyTimer is a simple recurent timer to help you with daily tasks.

Use it to remember to drink water or when you can have your next cigarette (so you don't smoke more than you want).

First you need to edit or create configurations for each timers, like the ones located in the `timers` folder.

```json
{
  "title": "Smoke timer",
  "message": "ðŸš¬  You can smoke, now.",
  "name": "cigarette",
  "bgColor": "bgRed",
  "timeTable": [
    0.5,
    0.8,
    1,
    1.1,
    1.25
  ]
}
```
You should set a title, a message, a name, a terminal bgColor and the time table. The last enter in the time table is repeated.
